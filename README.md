### One-Page Website
This page is an exmple of a home page for an affinity group (in this case dogs).  It is mostly a skeleton with very little styling, but contains a navbar, videos, an image gallery and a contact form. This is an html template.

### Academy Cinemas
Academy Cinemas is an html that is entirely sytlized utilizing Bootstrap 4. It contains many bootstrap elements, such as a navbar, jumbotron, card stack, pills, etc.

### Go Giants
This page is an example of a home page for a fanbase product site (San Francisco Giants hats).  It is entirely stylized using CSS and contains many components that a homepage may desire.  It has a navbar, image gallery, contact form and was built entirely from the ground up.

### Just messing around...
This page was built from the ground up to showcase some style elements.  It has a filtered image, a movie header, navbar, image and video text overalys, an abundace of hover effects, a table and other style opoints all built with CSS.
